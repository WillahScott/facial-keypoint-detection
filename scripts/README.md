* **`explorations/`** contains dataset explorations, plots and initial modeling attempts  

* **`preprocessors/`** contains the preprocessing scripts  

* **`modelers/`** contains all serious modeling attempts, including the generation of their submission files

* **`tools/`** contains a set of additional tools that make the exploration and modeling cleaner. For example `submit.py` contains functions for creating the submission files in the appropriate folder
